# Cluster-Count-in-Grid
The goal of this program is to implement Depth First Search recursive approach to count the number of clusters in a grid.

Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

# Input Format-

grid values

# Output Format-

Number of clusters in a grid

# Input Sample-

  5 4

  1 1 0 0

  0 0 1 0

  0 0 0 0

  1 0 1 1

  1 1 1 1

# Sample Output-

  Total Number of Clusters in List are 3
